# state_tut

A Flutter project.

## A London App Brewery Flutter Bootcamp tutorial application.

This is code typed in or copy/pasted in the process of learning to create applications using Flutter.


This is a special tutorial that walked me through:
- Basic App.
- Property Drilling: the act of passing data down the Widget Tree through Widgets that don't even want the data but must accept it so they can pass it along.
- Add the Provider package and remove Prop Drilling
- Get Provider to pass the data to only the Widgets that need it.
- Add a TextField to change the data and notify Widgets that are subscribed to update the data.
- Add "update once" (read vs watch) to one Widget.
